# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created in order to be a source of
information, gathered from the UT Boot Camp pre-work in fall of 2023.
It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
In addition, the prework study guide, in of itself, is a project
meant to teach a student how to create a webpage, and how to use
GitHub as a repository for the webpage.
